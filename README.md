## **Description**
---
The Professional README Generator is an application which you can use to generate a README with all the aspects you need. The application prompts the user with questions about their project like 'what is the title of your project?', 'what is the description of your project?', and a few more questions beyond those. Each of these questions will provide the information for the app to generate your new README file!

## **Installation**
---
To install this project make sure to first clone down the repository to your machine. You will then need to ensure you have Node.js downloaded and installed. Once you have that in order, you will lastly need to do `npm install` in the terminal while inside the main directory for the repository.

## **Usage**
---
To get started with the README generator yourself, follow the above installation guide first.

Once you have fully installed all the required components, you will need to type `node index.js` into the terminal while inside the main directory for the repository.

From this point forward you will be prompted with questions about your project. Make sure to answer them with the most descriptive and detailed responses because this will be directly generated into the README.

Once you have completed your README question prompts, you will find your newly generated README markdown file named 'GENERATED.md' in the main directory.
